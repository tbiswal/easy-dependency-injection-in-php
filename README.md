# Easy Dependency Injection In Php

Dependency injection is an important fundamental concept to organise your code and maintain code. Also it helps to follow software design principle commonly called separation of concerns in your application. 

## Getting Started
Clone this reposiotory, and install dependency using composer "php composer.phar install". Go to each folder, and run file using php fileName.php to see the result. I have used this test DB dump https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db. Please dump this data for mock test experiment in my repo.
